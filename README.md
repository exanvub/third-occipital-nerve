## Overview
This repository contains the supplementary data and scripts for the  **"In-vitro study of the third occipital nerve near the C2-3 facet joint and the association between its morphology and the presence of a third occipital nerve notch."** research paper. 
The study investigates the relationship between the third occipital nerve (TON), the C2-3 facet joint, and the presence of a TON notch, focusing on degenerative and morphological factors. 

## Repository Contents
- **Microscribe Data:** 3D coordinates of anatomical landmarks registered during cadaveric dissections using the Microscribe digitizer.
- **Data Analysis Script (Python):** Python script used for processing the Microscribe data, calculating nerve crossing angles, locations, and analyzing the anatomical relationships.
- **Checklist:** Anatomical checklist used for describing the morphology of the TON and C2-3 facet joint.
- **Statistical Analysis Script (R):** R script for performing logistic regression and other statistical analyses associated with degenerative/morphological characteristics and the presence of a TON notch.

## Data Description
- **Microscribe Data:** The data file contains 3D coordinates captured during dissections, used to calculate the anatomical relationships between the TON and the C2-3 facet joint. 
- **Checklist:** The checklist file provides details on nerve morphology, facet joint conditions, and degenerative changes observed during dissection.
